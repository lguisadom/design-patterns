# 🎯 Design Patterns - Quick Reference Repository

This repository contains practical examples of design patterns implemented in TypeScript. It's designed as a quick reference to consult when you need to implement or remember how a specific pattern works.

This is a **personal collection** of examples that I gather over time from various sources like courses, blogs, tutorials, and my own learning journey. It's meant to be brief, practical, and easily accessible for quick consultation.

## 🚀 Technologies

- **TypeScript** - For static typing and better development experience
- **Deno** - JavaScript/TypeScript runtime for quick execution without configuration

## 📁 Project Structure

```
design-patterns/
├── 01-creacionales/          # Object creation patterns
│   ├── 01-builder/           # Builder Pattern
│   ├── 02-fatory-method/     # Factory Method Pattern
│   └── 03-abstract-factory/  # Abstract Factory Pattern
├── helpers/                  # Shared utilities
└── README.md
```

## 🎮 How to Run

### With Deno (Recommended)
```bash
# Run a specific example
deno 01-creacionales/01-builder/example1/01.2-builder.ts
```

## 📚 Implemented Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- **Builder** - Step-by-step construction of complex objects
- **Factory Method** - Object creation without specifying their exact class
- **Abstract Factory** - Creation of families of related objects

## 🔧 Utilities

The project includes utilities in the `helpers/` folder:
- `colors.ts` - Console colors
- `sleep.ts` - Pause function for demonstrations

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for:
- ✅ Quick reference of design patterns
- ✅ Practical and executable examples
- ✅ Reference during development
- ✅ Learning and reviewing concepts
- ✅ Personal knowledge base of design pattern implementations

## 📝 Notes

- All examples are written in TypeScript for better readability and maintenance
- Deno is used for simplicity and to avoid complex configurations
- Examples are self-contained and immediately executable
- More patterns will be added as needed
- This is a personal learning collection - examples come from various sources and my own experimentation

**Enjoy exploring design patterns! 🚀**
